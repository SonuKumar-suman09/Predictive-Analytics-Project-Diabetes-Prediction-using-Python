🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Python

This project focuses on Predictive Analysis for Diabetes Prediction using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The goal is to analyze healthcare data and build machine learning models that can classify whether a patient is diabetic or non-diabetic based on medical attributes.

📌 Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic disease that requires early detection to prevent serious health complications. This project applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning classification techniques to predict diabetes and support data-driven healthcare decisions.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze healthcare data related to diabetes

Perform data preprocessing to handle missing and invalid values

Conduct exploratory data analysis using visualizations

Build and compare multiple classification models

Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
